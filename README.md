# AP_AHP_ANALYSIS_APP
GUI ver. of my ap_ahp analysis program. 
Instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5rO-wwT_e-YxTt98H9z_YhoMT0LXt-xFZLvzviX6W8/edit?usp=sharing

Takes in one or more spontaneous current clamp files, does
batch-analysis and gives their burst and properties of AP that occur as
singlets (i.e. not part of a burst). Summary data is also exported in an
excel file.

NOTES: 
- MAKE SURE TO DELETE ALL FILES FROM 'tempdata' FOLDER AFTER EACH USE!!!!!!
- EXCEL SUMMARY FILE IS SAVED IN 'summaryTable_Iclamp.xlsx', IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THIS SCRIPT!!! 
- Don't touch the analysis mode.
- the popup figures appear in the order in which the files were selected.


The Trace Viewer is still under construction so please refer to the popup figures for graphics.

For any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at minegishis@brandeis.edu
